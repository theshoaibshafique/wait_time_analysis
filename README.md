# 🛒 Customer Wait Time Analysis using Computer Vision

In this project, we leverage computer vision to calculate how long customers wait in a checkout line. By combining the power of cv2 for zone identification and the ultralytics YOLO model for customer detection and tracking, we accurately measure waiting times. Additionally, we use Roboflow's Supervision to annotate videos with zone lines, highlight each customer, and display their waiting times in real-time. 📸⏱️
